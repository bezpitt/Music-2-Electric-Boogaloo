I can tell the difference between the just and equal temperament but I really can't say I like on better than the other.
These chords have too much other stuff going on for me to tell.

Some points about this project:
None of them really sound like instruments except the bells.
I separated the chord and note makers.
Additive was fairly straightforward.
Subtractive was the most difficult.
It took a lot ot make it stable and a lot of playing around to make it sound like anything.
But now I actually think it sounds pretty good.
FM sounds good and kind of 80s, but nothing like the brass it is supposed to sound like.
Waveshaper sounds pretty boring.
